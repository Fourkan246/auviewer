Contributing to Auton Universal Viewer
======================================

Motivation
----------

There is currently an unmet need in the machine learning community for tooling
to quickly view & analyze large time-series datasets and facilitate annotation
by domain experts in an easy, portable way.

There is also an unmet need in the medical research & machine learning community
for efficiently encoding large multimodal datasets (e.g. of patient stays, animal
studies, etc.), characterizing & featurizing the datasets, facilitating
annotation by domain experts, and facilitating analysis by researchers & data
scientists.

This is why auviewer_, audata_, and ccdef_ have been shared and why contributing
to them can be rewarding and worthy of your time & efforts.
